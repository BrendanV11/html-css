# html-css Development

My HTML and CSS code done according to a Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann:

Some simple and interesting HTML and CSS for a clean, minimalistic website design.

Update:
1- Shows how to implement images and how to format them to enhance the users experience when navigating through the web page.
2- Shows how to use icons appropriately in order to add to the overall design of the web page.
3- Implementing some basic design rules (text formatting, spacing, color systems) to enhance aestetics and website flow.
4- Using gridbox and flexbox to position the elements neatly and strategically to draw the users attention to the important aspects of the design
as well as positioning in a structered manner for enhanced website flow.
5- Using button, anchor, heading etc... elements that the user can interact with (Non-functional at the moment).
